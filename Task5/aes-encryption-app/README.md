# AES Encryption Application

This application allows you to encrypt data using the AES algorithm, modify the key or plaintext, and calculate the avalanche effect.

## Setup

1. Run the application:
    ```sh
    python src/main.py
    ```

## Features

- Encrypt data using the AES algorithm.
- Save the key and plaintext to files.
- Encrypt and save the ciphertext to a file.
- Calculate the avalanche effect by modifying a single bit in the plaintext or key.
